# YouTube Duration

Often, when watching YouTube, I like to increase the playback rate to consume the media quicker. It's often easy to figure out the new video duration for a video, but what about for playlists?

I created the YouTube Duration app to figure out how long a YouTube playlist/video would take at higher speeds!

Simply enter in the link of a YouTube video/playlist URL and adjust the slider to the desired speed!
